# DeepFake Detection

## 🔍 Overview
**DeepFake Detection** is a deep learning and computer vision project designed to identify manipulated videos and images.  
The project demonstrates how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can analyze subtle inconsistencies to classify content as *Real* or *Fake*.  
It includes preprocessing, model training, and detection workflows, along with a sample video (`FaceForensics.mp4`) for testing.

## 📖 Project Description
DeepFake technology has emerged as a powerful application of artificial intelligence, enabling the creation of hyper-realistic synthetic videos and images. While this technology offers exciting opportunities in entertainment, education, and creative media, it also raises serious ethical and security concerns. DeepFakes can be misused for spreading misinformation, impersonation, and digital fraud, making their detection an urgent research challenge.  

This project applies deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect inconsistencies between authentic and synthetic content. By analyzing subtle visual artifacts and frame-level features, the model learns to differentiate between *Real* and *Fake* samples with promising accuracy.  

The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`DeepFakeDetection.ipynb`) demonstrating preprocessing, training, and inference. A sample video (`FaceForensics.mp4`) is also provided for immediate experimentation. All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` for easy setup.  

This project is intended for students, researchers, and developers interested in multimedia forensics and AI security. It serves as both an educational resource and a foundation for building real-world DeepFake detection systems.
